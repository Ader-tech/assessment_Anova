                                          Architectural Decisions
React Functional Components & Hooks: The entire UI is managed through React state and effects.

CSS Modules: Scoped styles using App.module.css to avoid class name collisions and improve modularity.

Drag-and-Drop: Implemented using @hello-pangea/dnd due to compatibility with current React versions.

LocalStorage Persistence: Tasks are saved in localStorage so data persists on refresh without a backend.

Single File Structure: Kept all logic in App.jsx for simplicity and to meet assessment scope.
